# Julia for Ruby

This is an attempt to embed the julia language in ruby.

## Install

> rake package
> [sudo] gem install [pkg/]jl4rb-???.gem

## Test

First,

> export JL4RB_HOME=<your julia home>

or 

> put it in your .bashrc or equivalent

Then,

> irb
> require 'jl4rb'
> Julia << 'LOAD_PATH'

## Troubles

1. htableh.inc in src/support directory is missing (copy it in include/julia of your julia directory) 

2. If (like me, on MacOSX) the result of the previous test is not the one expected, the reason may come from the fact that in the initialization of julia libpcre is required and failed to be loaded properly. Then, set

> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<your julia home>

If you don't want to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, another solution is to change the base/client.jl file as follows: 

+ split init_load_path into 2 functions

> function init_load_path()
>     vers = "v$(VERSION.major).$(VERSION.minor)"
>     global const LOAD_PATH = ByteString[
>         abspath(JULIA_HOME,"..","local","share","julia","site",vers),
>         abspath(JULIA_HOME,"..","share","julia","site",vers)
> ]
> end
> 
> function init_dl_load_path()
>     global const DL_LOAD_PATH = ByteString[]
> end

+ in _start function:

> init_load_path()
> init_dl_load_path() #to ba added!
